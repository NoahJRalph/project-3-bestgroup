## Description

BrainSync is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application that aims to create a collaborative forum for online users. The app allows users to securely access the platform using JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, enabling them to search, respond to, and create forums. Real-time updates and server interactions enhance the user experience, and the app is designed to be scalable for both mobile and desktop users.
